# Moral Relativism and Isolationism 

&gt; We cannot critic other cultures because we will never understand them well enough to make judgments about them *and* the values of respect and tolerance forbids us to take up a critical position to any other culture.

---

1. Can understand other cultures.

--

2. Not a respectful attitude towards other cultures

--

3. Others can criticize our own culture

--

4. Moral relativism allows us to praise other cultures

# Sheena Easton and Total Conflict

Sheena Easton describes the following scenario for her baby:

- Takes the morning train
- Works from nine 'til five
- Takes another train home again
- Finds Sheena Easton waiting for him

--

Sheena Easton and her baby are playing a **zero-sum (total conflict)** game.

- Akin to Holmes-Moriarty game (see: von Neumann and Morgenstern), or "matching pennies."
- Useful for modeling strategic counterterrorism dilemmas between a government and terrorist group.

# A Total Conflict Between Sheena Easton and Her Baby

|                         | Sheena Easton Stays Home       | Sheena Easton Goes to Baby's Work |
|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Baby Home Again**          |  -100, **100**         |  **100**, 0       |
| **Baby Stays at Work**             |   **50**, 0        |  -100, **100**        |

--

&lt;br /&gt;

Notice we have no pure strategies, and no Nash equilibrium.

- Sheena Easton wants to proverbially "match pennies."
- Her baby has diametrically opposed preferences, fearing for his safety.

Solution: mixed strategy.

# Congressman Astley's Re-election Platform

Assume Congressman Astley presides over a competitive district in which he seeks reappointment. He promises he's:

- Never gonna give you up.
- Never gonna let you down.
- Never gonna run around and desert you.
- Never gonna make you cry.
- Never gonna say goodbye.
- Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you.

Are these promises (if credible) sufficient to secure re-election?

# Caribbean Queen and Operation Urgent Fury

.pull-left[

Billy Ocean released "Caribbean Queen" in 1984.

- Emphasized sharing the same dream
- Hearts beating as one

"Caribbean Queen" is about the poor execution of Operation Urgent Fury.

- Coordination problems plagued its execution from the start.
- Echoed JCS chairman David Jones' frustrations with military establishment.
]

.pull-right[

![](http://wearethemighty.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GrenadaNewsCartoon.jpg)

*This seriously happened, btw..*
]

Billy Ocean is advocating for what became the Goldwater-Nichols Act.

- Wanted to take advantage of **economies of scale**, resolve **coordination problems** in U.S. military.

# The Good Day Hypothesis

We know the following about Ice Cube's day.

1. The Lakers beat the Supersonics.
2. No helicopter looked for a murder.
3. Consumed Fatburger at 2 a.m.
4. Goodyear blimp: "Ice Cube's a pimp."

--

This leads to two different hypotheses:

- `\(H_0\)`: Ice Cube's day is statistically indistinguishable from a typical day.
- `\(H_1\)`: Ice Cube is having a good day.

These hypotheses are tested using archival data from Ice Cube's life to estimate an item response model of the "goodness" of Ice Cube's days.

# Conclusion

Xaringan is a nifty Rstudio add-on/package for creating HTML presentations.

- I think I'm still more inclined toward Beamer but Xaringan has tons of flexibility.
- Have an interactive component to your presentation (e.g. `leaflet` or a Shiny app)? You probably want Xaringan.

Plus, you can put GIFs into your presentation with Xaringan. That's nifty. Maybe students will like that.
